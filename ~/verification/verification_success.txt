The authentication flow was successfully verified using `curl`.

--- Test Case: Full Signup and Login Cycle ---

1. A unique username and PIN were generated.
2. A POST request was sent to /api/auth/signup.
3. The server responded with a success message, confirming account creation.
4. A POST request was sent to /api/auth/login using the same credentials.
5. The server responded with a success message, confirming the login was successful.

--- Signup Response ---
{"message":"Account created successfully","username":"testuser_1766242234"}

--- Login Response ---
{"success":true,"message":"Login successful","username":"testuser_1766242234"}

This confirms that the server-side logic for user creation and authentication is working as expected.
